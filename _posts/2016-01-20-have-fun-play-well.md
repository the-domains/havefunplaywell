Welcome to Have Fun Play Well! The music studio for Laurel Wells and Chris Worswick provides education in Violin, Viola, Cello, and Piano performance. 

We believe that music is a lifelong pursuit, and that playing an instrument is both beneficial to the soul, as well as an enhancement to the mind. Also we believe that music education should be fun and not filled with stress. Thus we do our best to instill confidence, a sense of ease surrounding performance, and a love for the challenging but necessary preparations involved in learning to play musical instruments. 

This site is new, and will be under development until this notice is removed.
